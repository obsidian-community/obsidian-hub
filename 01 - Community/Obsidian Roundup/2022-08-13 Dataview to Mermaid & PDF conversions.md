# 2022-08-13: Dataview to Mermaid & PDF conversions
Sync highlights and annotations from Raindrop & execute codeblocks interactively, a la Jupyter.

## Obsidian Updates

*   Obsidian Mobile v1.3.1 is available for testing [on Android](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/817515900349448202/1006609288988463144) and iOS. It includes fixes up till v0.15.9 of Obsidian Desktop.

## Plugin News

*   Marcus Olsson [teased a preview](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/1005826839337521272) of a plugin that does calendar, kanban, and table views together. It currently uses its own data storage format but looks very exciting!

### Updates

_If you want a more comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out [this plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

### Pending

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool (BRAT)](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian43-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

## Feature Requests

*   A user [requested](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hovering-over-the-heading-of-a-note-and-a-pop-up-appears-that-shows-the-notes-title/41670) for showing the full note title on hovering over the title bar, in case the title has been truncated.
*   There was [a request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/embed-pdf-files-with-range-options/41677) for being able to embed page ranges from a PDF.
*   A user is [looking for a way](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-notes-kindle-workflow/41748) to push Obsidian notes to the Kindle for easier reading.

The current solution involves manually changing and pinning the sidebar, which is quite tedious.

## Guides
