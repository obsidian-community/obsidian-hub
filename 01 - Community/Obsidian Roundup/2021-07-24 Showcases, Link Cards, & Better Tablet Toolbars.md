# 2021-07-24: Showcases, Link Cards, & Better Tablet Toolbars
The QuickAdd developer wants to know what you want to know, TTRPG maps came to mobile, & some nice new notetaking workflows.

## In The Community

- There’ll be a community showcase for themes, plugins & snippets this Saturday 24th (today!) at 17:00 (CET) (about 4 hours after the roundup arrives in your inbox). It will kick off with `@SkepticMystic`’s [[breadcrumbs]] and `@SlRvb`’s snippets! To sign up for a timeslot, use [this form](https://forms.gle/GjCnroTx7roCdhuq6).

## Obsidian Updates

## Plugin News

### New

- There’s a new [[advanced-toolbar|Advanced Mobile Toolbar]] plugin. It lets the toolbar always be visible and show two rows at the same time. Probably handy for tablets!
- You can now get [[obsidian-rich-links|Rich Links]] / link cards in Obsidian!
- You can [[garble-text|Garble Text]] using the command palette now.
- You can [access the spellcheck menu from the keyboard](https://github.com/zapthedingbat/obsidian-keyboard-context-menu-fix-plugin) now.
- You can [[homepage|define a “Home” note for startup]].

### Updates

- The lead developer of the Dictionary API is not a member of the Obsidian community, but if you are using the [[obsidian-dictionary-plugin|Dictionary]], you are using his work—and he needs help! The API is not free to maintain and it’s costs a bunch of money in AWS bills, so if you’re a frequent user, please consider [donating](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI).
- [[quickadd]] updated 3 times and now has a nicer mobile interface, support for inline JavaScript execution, and a bunch of new macro commands. Most importantly, `@Christian` is working on a video guide so if you have questions about (or requests for) QuickAdd please [fill out this survey](https://forms.gle/6dAit3XKjVrcrxxS8).
- [[obsidian-dice-roller|Dice Roller]] [5.0.0](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller) has support for rolling random blocks of notes.
- [[breadcrumbs]] can now generate an index for you.
- The [[obsidian-statusbar-pomo|status bar pomodoro plugin]] can now log completed pomos.
- [[obsidian-filename-heading-sync|Filename Heading Sync]] is back and better than ever!
- [[obsidian-leaflet-plugin|Obsidian Leaflet]] is now mobile compatible! Here’s an [example of how cool it looks](http://discordapp.com/channels/686053708261228577/805952223124520961/867574568574648352).

### Under The Radar

- Don’t forget, you can [use formulas in markdown tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian/blob/main/docs/help.md#using-formulas-in-markdown-tables) with the[[table-editor-obsidian|Advanced Tables]] plugin!
- Tidy Footnotes renumbers your footnotes if you add on in after the fact.

### For Developers

- `@Roamhacker` put together [this diagram](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/702656734631821413/866632447944163348) of the main css classes in Obsidian.

## Workflow Stuff

- [You can iframe a calibre ebook to read an ebook in one Obsidian pane while taking notes in the other](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/workflow-reading-ebook-epub-mobi-azw-etc-in-obsidian/17977/7)
- How I go from [research to notes to stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sxyYbh5mio) video `@nickmilo` is live on YouTube, along with the AMA. If you were present and asked questions in the chat I missed, I answered them [on my blog](https://eleanorkonik.com/now-available-my-notes-stories-shortform-articles/).
- There was a nice conversation about the [pros and cons of different tools for highlighting browser articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/oo96v0/trying_to_collect_my_browsing_highlights_through/) over on Reddit.
- Here’s a nice guide for [how to build a habit tracker in Obsidian](https://www.owenvachell.com/how-to-build-a-habit-tracker-in-obsidian/).

### Showcases

A bunch of people shared their vaults this week, including me!

- [My working vault](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/iterative-rainbow-folder-colors-css/21066) isn’t so much a pruned [[Digital garden|digital garden]] as a raw dump of my working files. I published it to make it easier to point people to examples of things. The raw [.zip](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/changelog-20210708/) is also available on my website behind a small paywall, since it also includes my actual WIP articles and fiction.
- [Mister Chad’s beautiful art resources](https://mister-chad.com/) were created for his students, but it’s an absolutely beautiful exemplar of an [[Obsidian Publish]] vault and has a lot of great visual design resources. Here’s the [git repo](github repo for the theme).
- [Singlanguages](https://publish.obsidian.md/singlanguages/500+Singlanguages/Welcome+Page) is a vault about the languages of Singapore and has resources for learning a second language.
- Also, `@tallguyjenks` has [4 hours of PKM content](https://youtu.be/wB89lJs5A3s) going live on Monday at 08:30 UTC-7. It’s a comprehensive look into personal knowledge management, with lots of definitions covered, an overview of his system, and a skeleton vault for people to play with.

## Feature Requests

- A bunch of folks are interested in having [Graph View presets to save and load filters & display settings](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/graph-view-presets-to-save-and-load-filters-display-settings/8131). In general there’s definitely a desire for a more robust “core” graph experience for people who don’t need the fancy Juggl stuff… ;)
- There was a lengthy [discussion on the forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/concept-map-plugin-idea/21256) about how much folks would like a concept map plugin (as opposed to just a mind map). Think Scrapple & Miro.
- `@pseudometa` put together [code to merge embedded notes](http://discordapp.com/channels/686053708261228577/722584061087842365/867858741370421269) into one `.md` note and was hoping someone could help out by turning it into a plugin.

## Appearance

- [[Minimal]] theme has improved support for iOS.
- `@vainilie` shared their snippets and tricks for getting an absolutely beautiful daily note widget [over on GitHub](https://github.com/ohlinn/vainilla-style#daily-note).
- The [[Horizon]] theme was added to the community themes list.
- This [css snippet](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/iterative-rainbow-folder-colors-css/21066) will iteratively color folders.

## Knowledge Management

- `@hstanger` shared part three of their [digital smart notes series](https://harleystagner.com/digital-smart-notes-in-obsidian-part-3-how-to-create-permanent-notes/), about taking permanent notes in Obsidian.

## [[🗂️ 02.04 Auxiliary Tools by Category|Ancillary tools]]

- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is another option for hosting your [[Digital garden|digital garden]] as a webpage for you, with no web experience required. The developer seems nice and its optimized for Obsidian. It even has a little graph and backlinks
- [[YiNote]] is a [[Chrome Extensions|chrome extension]] that lets you take timestamped notes while watching youtube videos.
- The book [Professional Git](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Git-Brent-Laster/dp/111928497X) was edited by a community member and comes recommended for people who like textbooks for learning computer concepts. Git is a tool to help manage collaboration and version control that is pretty popular in this community, but can be overwhelming at first.
