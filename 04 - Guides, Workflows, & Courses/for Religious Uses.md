# for Religious Uses
The [[🗂️ 01 - Community|Obsidian Community]] has created plenty of resources for studying religious texts.

## Plugins
- The [[obsidian-bible-reference|Bible Reference Plugin]] will let you "fetch" a particular passage of the Bible from [ESV.org](https://www.esv.org/).
- With [[obsidian-bible-linker|Bible Linker]], you can quickly copy bible verses and create links to them.
- [[obsidian-daf-yomi|Daf Yomi]] helps you prepare for the [daily practice of learning the Oral Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi) by downloading the day's PDF (one page of the [Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud)) and links to commentary and other resources.
- The [[obsidian-quran-lookup|Quran Lookup Plugin]] replaces `chapter:verse` shorthand with verse text in arabic and translation.

## Media Resources
- [[Chris Wilson]] has multiple YouTube videos about how he uses Obsidian to take notes on the Bible. Here is an introduction to his "Biblekasten": [How to set up Obsidian to take digital Bible notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT4g59YCbd0)
- In the video [Jeff Cavins' CRAZY Note Taking System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TeRR9KnLDg), Jeff Cavins talks about how he links together theological and philosophical ideas from books and other sources.
- [[selfire1|Joschua]] shared how he uses the [[Linking Your Thinking]] framework by [[nickmilo|Nick Milo]] to integrate his religious learnings into a PKM system.
- There is also [this Meta Post on organising the Bible](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/organising-the-bible-in-obsidian/1490) that Joschua compiled.
- [[Mark McElroy]] wrote [a useful blog post](https://markmcelroy.com/spatial-models-for-relating-ideas/) on effectively capturing information, creating spatial relationships between ideas and keeping track of supporting and differing viewpoints.

## Vaults, Kits and Converters
- [av-obsidian](https://github.com/pmbauer/av-obsidian) is a script by [[pmbauer]] which creates a formatted version of the [King James Bible/Authorized Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version).
- Joschua is a rich source for inspiration if you want to try digital Bible Studies:
	- He published the [Bible Study in Obsidian Kit](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bible-study-in-obsidian-kit-including-the-bible-in-markdown/12503) and also wrote [BibleGateway-to-Obsidian](https://github.com/selfire1/BibleGateway-to-Obsidian), a script to import various versions of the Bible. 
	- The tool is also available in French and German.
- [gapmiss](https://github.com/gapmiss) has [shared two Bible Study kits](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/introducing-kingdom-study-tools-for-obsidian/40394) as well.
	- A Markdown version of the [Berean Study Bible](https://github.com/gapmiss/berean-study-bible-for-obsidian).
	- The [Kingdom Study Tools](https://github.com/gapmiss/kingdom-study-tools-for-obsidian) which includes the KJV Bible with links to definitions, Hebrew & Greek Lexicons and [Noah Webster's Dictionary of the English Language](https://archive.org/details/noah-websters-1828-dictionary-ellen-g-white-estate) (1828). 
- [mdbible](https://github.com/lguenth/mdbible) is a JSON-to-[[Markdown]] converter for [Javascripture's online bible](https://javascripture.org/), written by [[lguenth|Luke]]. Currently, only the ESV is provided but he is taking requests for other versions and formats.

If you have come across other resources for working with religious content inside Obsidian, feel free to add them to this page! In the discussions leading up to the creation of this note, [some people chimed in on GitHub to share their workflows](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/issues/449).
