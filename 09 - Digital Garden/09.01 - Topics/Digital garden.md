# Digital garden

## What is a digital garden?

We borrow the definition of a digital garden from [[A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden]]:

![[A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden#^883251]]

In the Obsidian Discord, it's common to find extensions of this metaphore with concepts like the [[08 - Seedbox|seedbox]] or [[Tag glossary|tags]] like the ones we use in this vault
