## Summary

Track checklist items/tasks across your entire vault. Query them and mark them as done wherever you want. Supports due dates, recurring tasks (repetition), done dates, sub-set of checklist items, and filtering.

Tasks tracks your checklist items from your vault. The simplest way to create a new task is to create a new checklist item. The markdown syntax for checklist items is a list item that starts with spaced brackets: `- [ ] take out the trash`. Now Tasks tracks that you need to take out the trash!

A more convenient way to create a task is by using the `Tasks: Create or edit` command from the command palette. You can also bind a hotkey to the command. The command will parse what's on the current line in your editor and pre-populate a modal. In the modal, you can change the task's description, its due date, and a recurrence rule to have a repeating task.
