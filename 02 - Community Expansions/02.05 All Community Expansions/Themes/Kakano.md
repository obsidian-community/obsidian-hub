## Features

- [[Themes with Friendly Settings|Friendly settings]]: Supports the [[obsidian-style-settings|Style Settings]] plugin

## Customization Options (Style Settings Plugin) 
### Base color
The Kakano theme uses a base color for each vault, and generates different shades and gradients from it. You can either select from one of the preset colors, or specify an exact color.
- Preset base color: If you just want a quick color, choose one of these.
- Exact base color: Set an exact base color. Make sure "Preset base color" is empty, and click Save to apply.
### Other color settings
- Background gradient contrast: Degree of contrast for background gradients. Set to zero for a flat background color.
- Light mode note background: In light mode, note backgrounds can be full white (default) or near white with a slight tint of the base color.
- Dark mode note background: In dark mode, note backgrounds can be near black (default) or full black. Near black is a bit easier on the eyes. Full black will save a little energy on OLED screens which will switch back pixels completely off. And some people just like the way it looks.
### Layout settings
- Mobile horizontal spacing: Width of space to the left and right of the note content. Set to zero if you'd like the note to extend to the full width, 0.5 or 1 if you'd like to see your background gradient."
- Properties position: Place properties before or after your main note content. Note that this only applies to Live Preview mode
- Embedded note titles: When a note is embedded in another note, show or hide the source note's title."
### Typography settings
- Heading scale factor – desktop/tablet: Scale factor for heading sizes. Larger numbers will increase the difference between different heading sizes, smaller numbers will decrease the difference.
- Heading scale factor – phone: Scale factor for heading sizes on smaller phone screens. With space at a premium, you'll usually want this to be smaller than the desktop scale factor"
### Experimental settings
These settings may be unfinished or unstable!: This section contains settings for Kakano features that you may find useful, but which aren't as finished as I'd like. They may also be features I don't use personally, so I'm less likely to notice if they have rough edges. If there's something here that you use, feel free to drop me some feedback in the [Github issues queue](https://github.com/isaacfreeman/kakano-obsidian-theme/issues), and I'll aim to improve features that I know have active users."
- Embedded links scroll position: Embedded links can be placed at the below your content (so you scroll to the bottom to see them), or pinned so they stay visible as you scroll.
