## Features

- [[Themes with Friendly Settings|Friendly settings]]: Supports the [[obsidian-style-settings|Style Settings]] plugin

## Customization Options (Style Settings Plugin) 
- Welcome!: Use these settings to adjust basic extra settings or various extra elements of the theme. Visit the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/FireIsGood/obsidian-everforest-enchanted) for more information.


**Editor**: Line length, line numbers, folders
- **Folders**: 
    - Enable highlighted active folders: Adds a background on opened folders.
- **Line Length**: 
    - Line length: Sets a custom readable line width in pixels.
    - Wide Line length: Sets a custom readable line width for the CSS class "wide-width" in pixels.
- **Line Numbers**: 
    - Disable stacked tabs floating line numbers: Disables custom line number floating in the stacked tab mode. This makes the line numbers shift over the content in stacked tabs. Use this if your panes are too thin to show them.
- **Menu modals**: 
    - Disable menu animations: Disables the floating-up animation of modal menus (e.g. settings, command palette).
    - Enable menu blur: Blur the content behind modal menus (e.g. settings, command palette).
    - Menu blur radius: The amount to blur in pixels.

**Elements**: Lists, tables, canvas
- **Canvas**: 
    - Canvas - Background dot size: The size of dots on the canvas. It starts breaking past 10.
- **Image Embeds**: 
    - Image Embeds - Enable zoom: Enable zooming in on images by clicking on them. Just like minimal! Note that mobile Obsidian already has this.
    - Image Embeds - Disable dragging: Stop zoomed images from being dragged around. This breaks the blur keyword.
    - Image Embeds - Stretch all images to fit the full width: Makes all images stretch to fit the full width by default. Added as an option to revert behavior.
- **Links**: 
    - Links - Remove external link icon: Removes the link icon from external links.
- **Lists**: 
    - Lists - List indent size: The size of list item indents. The default value of 18px mimics the appearance of editing mode. If you want a more default experience, the default theme uses 32 px.
- **Tables**: 
    - Tables - Center alignment: Aligns tables to the center.
    - Tables - Full width: Makes tables fit the full width.
    - Tables - Rounded corners: Adds a rounded effect to table corners. Automatically disabled when a table has rowspan as it is not possible to guarantee the correct corners are rounded.
    - Tables - Rounded corners radius: The corner radius of rounded tables. You may need to reload tabs to see the effect.

**Extras**: Stacked pane count, background image, visual parity
- **Stacked Pane Count**: 
    - Info: This setting turns stacked panes from a pixel width to a number visible on screen at once. Check the [GitHub Repo documentation](https://github.com/FireIsGood/obsidian-everforest-enchanted/blob/main/custom_stacked_panes.md) for more information.

    - Custom Stacked Panes: Changes stacked panes to fit a certain number on screen instead of using pixel values.
    - Pane Count: The number of panes to show up at once.
- **Background Image**: 
    - Info: Adds background images. This is easiest to do with an external URL. If you want to use local images for offline access, you'll have to use a snippet. Check the [GitHub Repo documentation](https://github.com/FireIsGood/obsidian-everforest-enchanted/blob/main/custom_background_image.md) for more information.

    - Background Image: Enables the background image.
    - Dark Mode Background URL: Set an online background image.
    - Light Mode Background URL: Set an online background image.
    - Background Position: Change where the image is centered.
    - Pane Opacity: How opaque page backgrounds are.
    - UI Opacity: How opaque UI backgrounds are.
    - Tab Opacity: How opaque STACKED TAB backgrounds are.
    - **Fun Settings**: 
        - Pane view: Changes pages to be panes on a transparent background. BEST USED WITH UI OPACITY 0!
- **Visual Parity**: 
    - Info: Changes reading mode to match editing mode visually.

    - Visual Parity: Changes reading mode to match editing mode.
