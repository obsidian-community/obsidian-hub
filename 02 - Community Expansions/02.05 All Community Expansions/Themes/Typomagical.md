## Features

- [[Themes with Friendly Settings|Friendly settings]]: Supports the [[obsidian-style-settings|Style Settings]] plugin

## Customization Options (Style Settings Plugin) 
- Title font: Titles, or H1s, are special. Thus, they should look special. Choose a Title font that suits you!
- Title weight: The boldness of H1 text
- Title alignment: The horizontal alignment
- Title gradient: Apply a vertical gradient to titles
- Heading weight: The boldness of headings. I recommend choosing something different from your Title weight, and Body weight
- Heading scale: The rate of growth between text and heading sizes. No scaling means headings and body text are the same size. Blank means Typomagical will attempt to choose the right scale based on your screen size.
- Heading line height: Height of each line in headings. I recommend around 1.2. If you have Embedded Note Titles plugin, that setting overrides this.
- Heading ligatures: Decorative conjoined characters, such as the "ffi" in "office" and "ft" in "often".
