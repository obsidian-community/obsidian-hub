- Disable Blurred Background Effect: Disables the blur background in all elements that use it by making them opaque.
- Disable Prism Callout Styling: This option removes the custom Callout Styling introduced with Prism and reverts to a completely default look. This should be used if you prefer the default callout styling or have CSS Snippets that use it's customisation options.
- Disable Mark Highlight Styling: This option removes the Prism Mark Highlight Styling (reverts to default look). This will be handy for those that already use a different <mark> tag based highlighting system.
- Collapsed Pinned Tabs: This option removes the title from pinned tabs and adds back the default file icon for the markdown files. Helps reduce the horizontal space wasted by pinned tabs. You can still see the title when you hover over the icon. NOTE - This option requires Installer Version 1.1.9+ due to use of CSS `has()`. Also, might not work on certain Mobile clients.
- Enable PDF Dark Theme: This option adds styling to the PDF pages by blending in with the colour scheme in Dark mode; making it more eye friendly. This isn't a perfect solution. Note that some images might look inverted and colours be a different shade compared to the original file.
