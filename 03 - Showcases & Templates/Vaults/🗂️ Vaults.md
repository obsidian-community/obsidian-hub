## Contributing

### Vault structure

Here are a few suggestions on how you can share your vault structure:

- A screenshot of your file explorer
- Using headers or bullets to explain your folder hierarchy. Example's include:
  - [Eleanor Konik's JD System](https://publish.obsidian.md/eleanorkonik/00+Meta/03+Structure/JD+System+2021-08-22)
  - [Leah Ferguson's File Hierarchy SOP](<https://publish.obsidian.md/leah/00+Meta/04+SOP/File+Hierarchy+(SOP)>)
- Or using the `tree` command in the terminal (for Linux/MacOS)

TODOs:
- [ ] Add examples for the other types of contributions
%%

After that, the interesting bit comes from the *why* you organized things the way you did, so adding a small description and explanation is of course welcome!

### Starter vaults or kits

Unfortunately, we can't host starter vaults or kits in the community vault itself, or it would be chaos! We recommend hosting your vault externally (GitHub is recommended) and providing a link as described in [[#Contribution steps]].

### Contribution steps

The steps for both are roughly the same:

1. Create a new note under [[🗂️ Vaults]]
2. Apply one of the following templates:
   - the [[T - Vault showcase]] template for starter vaults or kits
   - [[T - Folder structure]] if you're sharing how you've organized your vault (or a part of it)
3. Fill out any placeholders
4. [[How to add content through GitHub|Submit your changes to GitHub]]
