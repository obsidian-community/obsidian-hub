The `Digital Art Composition Book` vault is designed to facilitate keeping a digital composition book of art. Basically the digital equivalent to a paper art comp book that some artists are never without.

Digital art tends to have more constraints than traditional art and this vault is designed to help wrangle your digital art into a form that's similar in feel to a more traditional, paper art comp book.

## Who is this for?

The `Digital Art Composition Book` is meant for anyone who practices a form of digital art and wants to create and manage a comp book in a digital form. Professionals, hobbyists, folk filling in coloring pages and others are all welcome.

The vault is designed to be adaptable and work for any artist of any skill level working on any form of art.

## Using the Vault

The vault is setup as a series of folders for organizing different types of digital art and uses gallery notes to help with navigating the art stored within the vault. The main folders are 'types' of art and sub-directories are used to help organize art based on progress.

The vault also contains a `Notes` section that includes some useful information and can be added to over time as well as an `Ideas - Inspiration` folder that can be used to track ideas and inspiration that you may want to use in the future.

For additional detail: the vault contains a `__Using The Vault` note in the `Notes` folder that gives a full breakdown on how to use the vault and how it is organized. The main download URL below also contains a link to this file so you can view it on the web prior to downloading the vault.
