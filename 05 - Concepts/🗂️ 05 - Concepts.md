# 🗂️ 05 - Concepts

Confused by all the technical lingo like [[YAML frontmatter|YAML]], [[Markdown|Markdown]], [[SCSS]], or [[LaTeX|LaTeX]]? Or feel overwhelmed by all the different "schools" and techniques of Personal Knowledge Management like [[Spaced repetition]], [[PARA]], or [[Digital garden]]?

Then this is the right folder for you. Here, the various technical and knowledge-management-related concepts are briefly explained. Think of this folder as some sort of small Wikipedia for all the terms that you frequently encounter.
